# workshop link archive 
This repo contains the archive of workshop links and the old starting page for eScience academy.

**The old starting page, https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/ is now redirected to: https://www.esciencecenter.nl/events/?f=workshops**

## Adding new links
To add new links, edit the `links.csv` file. 
Add a new line with the slug and the url (you don't need to add something to 'other_url' that is just for older workshops).

## Backup of old _posts
All data should be in `links.csv`, but if you miss anything you can always have 
a look at the old posts in the `_posts` folder [here](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/tree/29cf5c53fb94e9b1868b88bac0f5dde90068d63b)
