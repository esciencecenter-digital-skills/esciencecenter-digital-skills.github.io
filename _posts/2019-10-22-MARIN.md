title: Software Carpentry and Parallel Programming, Oct 2019, MARIN
---
We had a workshop at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands ([MARIN](https://www.marin.nl)). The focus of the workshop was on using [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). The second part of the workshop used the materials from the [Parallel programming in Python workshop](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2019/10/08/Amsterdam.html) earlier this month.
