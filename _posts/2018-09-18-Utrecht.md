title: Good practices in research software, September 2018 - Utrecht
---
Our September 2018 round of essential skills workshops covered was quite special:

We focused on [Good practices in research software ](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2018-09-18-Utrecht/)
using newly developed material from [the carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (which we helped developing).
And with the help of Jeroen Engelberts from [SURFsara](https://www.surf.nl) we focused on
[High Performance Computing for Research ](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2018-09-19-Utrecht/).

It was also Jeroen's last workshop working with SURF -- all the best to him
in his new path, and I hope we will be able to work together in the future.
