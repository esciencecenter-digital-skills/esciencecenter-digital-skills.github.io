We were invited to organize the lab sessions during the CDT summer school at the
Met Office in Exeter, UK. The [lab sessions](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2018-06-25-UK-MetOffice-Summer-school)
covered a range of topics such as git, NetCDF and cartopy. Students also had
the time to work on their own mini-project, which they presented at the end of
the week.
