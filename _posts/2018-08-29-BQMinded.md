title: Software Carpentry, Aug 208, BQ-Minded summer school
---
We were invited to participate in the BQ-Minded summer school, in Antwerp, Belgium. [This workshop](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2018-08-29-BQMinded/) covered Unix Shell & Task Automation and Introduction to Git/GitHub from the standard Software Carpentry curriculum, plus a custom session on Scientific data analysis with Python. In this lesson we focused on model fitting and image processing.

We also wrote [a blog](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/want-to-organize-a-workshop-on-image-processing-5727d2347de2) post about this workshop and poster it over at [the carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/09/image_processing_resources/).
