We had a workshop at the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) Earth Observation, Science & Society Symposium. The focus of the workshop was on [data science tooling](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2019-10-10-NSO-Symposium), and we showed participants how to work with NetCDF data using Iris.
